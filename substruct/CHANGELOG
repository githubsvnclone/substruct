Substruct Version Changelog and Update Notes
===============================================================================

Version 0.8
---------------------------------------
Fixed:
  - Made sure questions require title.
    - This makes sure you can actually click on all questions from the UI (whoops!)
  - DB setup was flawed, see migrations note.

	Migrations Note
	-----
	Loading db from the schema.rb file was seriously fucked, causing problems with duplicate columns and other nonsense. 

	I've relabeled the migrations, adding the initial DB state as 001. Every other migration has been bumped up 1 version.

	Upgraders might have to change your engine_schema_info table....just an alert.

Version 0.75
---------------------------------------
Added:
	- Ability to download orders on admin side in XML and CSV for export
	  to other applications like QuickBooks
	
Upgrade steps:
	0. gem install fastercsv
	
Updated:
	- Updated to Rails 1.1.6
	- Updated to Engines 1.1.4
	

Version 0.7
---------------------------------------
Added:
	- Role Based Access Control

Updated:
	- Updated to Rails 1.1.2 - now included in the vendor directory
	- New authority data for FedEx, be sure to reload authority data!
	
Fixed:
	- Content URLs now auto-clean before validation (Ticket #22)
	- Estimation of international FedEx packages.
	  - Including the shipping gem as a library now.
	- Bug on new product creation where tags weren't being saved properly.
	- Bug where it was impossible to clear all tags from a product once assigned.
	- Adding multiple items to the cart object. Before it was only adding 1 at a time.

Upgrade steps:
  0. rake rails:update

	1. rake db:migrate:engines:substruct
	
	2. rake load_authority_data
     !!! WARNING !!!
     This could overwrite your admin user! All that's needed is to 
     update the shipping tables, so you could possibly extract those 
     records by themselves and insert by hand.

     Yes, I know it should have probably been a migration...sorry.

	3. Create an application specific application.rb file. 
		 (your_rails_dir/app/controllers/application.rb)
		 It's contents should look like this:
		
				class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
				  include SubstructApplicationController
				end

     This makes sure that everything is loaded properly. Newer versions of
     Rails were causing issues with loading the application controller from
     the engines directory.
	


Version 0.61
---------------------------------------
Updated:
  - New routes.rb file - you need to copy this into your config directory!
  This supports the new store show_by_tags with multiple tags.
  - Changed store/show_by_tags to display friendly URLs
    (Tags are now passed in by name, not ID)
  - Changed AJAX cart to display 1 physical item for each item / quantity in the cart.
    (no more "x2", etc)
  - Broke out some CSS into include files for the cart.

Upgrade steps:
	0. Copy the new routes.rb to your config directory, or merge the changes.

Version 0.6
---------------------------------------
Added:
	- Tagging for products
	- Maintenance of product tags
	- Automatic image thumbnail / small size creation via RMagick

Updated:
	- Better shopping cart experience with AJAX cart
	- Faceted navigation of product categories
	- Fixed bug where product images would auto-delete when updating something else about a product.

Upgrade steps:

	0. Update the source

			tar -xzvf substruct.tar.gz my_rails_app/vendor/plugins/

	1. Update the DB

			rake engine_migrate

	2. Add blank loading html file for modal. This page gets swapped into the modal dialog (as seen when editing tags) when it's not visible.

			touch public/loading.html

	3. Install RMagick

			This is necessary for automatic image resizing of product images
