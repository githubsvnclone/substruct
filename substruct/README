= Installing Substruct =

== Preamble ==

'''Substruct is a framework that includes'''
 * CMS / Blogging tools
 * E-Commerce engine
   * Shopping cart
   * Shipping rate calculation through FedEx
   * Online processing via Authorize.net
   * Inventory management
   * Order management
 * Admin area to administer site
 * Q/A system with integrated FAQ

This software package is developed using the Engines plugin. To find out more about how to use engines in general, go to http://rails-engines.org

'''These directions assume you already have a working Rails hosting environment. This means...'''
 * A web server such as
   * Webrick (included with Rails)
   * Apache
   * Lighttpd
 * MySQL (PG works as well, but I don't support it in the main distro)
 * Ruby
 * Rails (1.0+, 1.1.2 is currently included with the application)
 
''We're currently working on an installation script...for now though follow the directions...'''

== Installation ==

0. Install the following gems...This engine is dependent on them!
 * Payment
 * Shipping
 * RedCloth
 * RMagick

{{{
#!sh

gem install payment
gem install shipping
gem install RedCloth

}}}

For RMagick you might want to check out this url:
http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html

!! NOTE !! Be sure net/ssl is also installed. For Debian linux boxes this is _not_ included in the default Ruby installer. If you are running on debian it's as easy as typing 'apt-get install libopenssl-ruby1.8'

1. Create your Rails application. Make sure you at least have Rails 1.0 installed. 1.1.2 is currently packaged with the distribution, and Substruct will run off of that.

{{{
#!sh

rails myapp

}}}

!!! INCLUDE SUBSTRUCT IN YOUR APPLICATION !!!

Make sure myapp/app/controllers/application.rb file looks something like this

{{{
#!ruby

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include SubstructApplicationController
end

}}}

!!! MAKE SURE TO DELETE application_helper.rb !!!
You don't need it for a basic Substruct app.
Create a blank "loading.html" page.

{{{
#!sh

rm myapp/app/helpers/application_helper.rb
touch myapp/public/loading.html
rm myapp/public/index.html

}}}

2. Install Substruct into your vendor/plugins directory.

{{{
#!sh

mv substruct.tar.gz myapp/vendor/
cd myapp/vendor/
tar -xzvf substruct.tar.gz
cd ..

}}}

3. Copy and modify all of the files from ./config_stubs into your /config directory.

{{{
#!sh

cp vendor/plugins/substruct/config_stubs/* config/

}}}

The YML files for shipping and payment should be filled out with proper values, but make sure to ALSO fill in the default GLOBAL vars in your environment.rb.

The gems both don't seem to pick up on the values from the config files in a reliable manner, so I'm loading them there instead. !!!This might change in the future!!!

Perform any configuration you might need. You'll probably want to set these values in environment.rb (before the call to Engines.start):

{{{
#!ruby

module Substruct
 config :some_option, "some_value"
end

}}}

4. Setup databases for substruct to work & Edit your database.yml file
 Create the following:

 * substruct_development
 * substruct_test
 * substruct_production

 Make sure to setup your database.yml to access those new db's properly

5. Initialize the database tables using the following unix commands. Translate to DOS if you need to.

This loads the initial schema, updates to the latest using migrations, then finally loads authority data into the DB.

{{{
#!sh

cp vendor/plugins/substruct/db/* db/
chmod +w db/schema.rb
rake db:schema:load
rake load_authority_data
rake db:migrate:engines:substruct 
rake db:migrate:engines:substruct  RAILS_ENV='production'


}}}

6. Substruct provides a default stylesheet and a small javascript helper file, so you'll probably want to include the former and almost certainly the latter in your application's layout. Add the following lines:

{{{
#!text/html

<%= engine_stylesheet "substruct" %>
<%= engine_javascript "substruct" %>

}}}

== Configuration ==

A number of configuration parameters are available to allow to you control
how the data is stored, should you be unhappy with the defaults. These are
outlined below.

{{{
#!ruby

module Substruct
	# Should we use live rate calculation via FedEx?
	config :use_live_rate_calculation, false
	
	# Override SSL production mode?
	# If set to true the cart and checkout are accessed via HTTP not HTTPS
	# regardless of the mode that the server is run in.
	# 
	# This is useful for me on the demo site where I don't want
	# to set up a SSL cert.
	config :override_ssl_production_mode, false
end

}}}

== Usage ==

Fire up your environment!

{{{
#!sh

ruby script/server

}}}

Try to login to http://localhost:3000/admin as ''admin'' / ''admin''

=== Misc ===

If you're going to be doing credit card transactions you need a processor account. [wiki:AuthorizeNet Check out how to get one.]
